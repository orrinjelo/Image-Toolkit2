FFTWSharp
===========

Basic C# wrapper for FFTW.


Features
============

* Unmanaged function calls to main FFTW functions for both single and double precision
* Basic managed wrappers for FFTW plans and unmanaged arrays
* Test program that demonstrates basic functionality


Notes
============

* Most of this was written in 2005
* Slightly updated since to get it running with Visual Studio Express 2010
* If you have a question about FFTW, ask the FFTW people, and not me. I did not write FFTW.
* If you have a question about this wrapper, probably still don't ask me, since I wrote it almost a decade ago.
